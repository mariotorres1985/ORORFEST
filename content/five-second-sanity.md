Polymath [Evan Dumas](http://research-club.org/people/evan-dumas/) brings one of his latest projects to [Pitchfest](http://calagator.org/events/1250466915). Five Second Sanity isn't publically available yet, so this is one of your only chances to try it!  Eva is the man behind [Man's Face Stuff](http://www.mansfacestuff.com/), so if you like what you smell, maybe you can convince him to share it with the world.

##Catch Neka and Kahlo's performance at [Pitchfest](http://calagator.org/events/1250466915) 

The two came together in 2012 to form a duo that conjures a unique synthesis of sound and style. They come from very different cultural/artistic backgrounds and work across genres- blending elements of urban contemporary, hip hop, indie pop, industrial, ethereal, trap and electronic dance music. Together they will take you on a musical initiation into the mysteries of the third wave…

[Willamette Week](http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-22554-introducing_neka_kahlo.html) describes their sound as "The raw frustration of Eminem’s identity crisis encountering the soulful wisdom of Adele, with Skrillex on the decks."

In 2009 at Mountain Home Farm, we discovered a rogue hot pepper in a field of sweet Jimmy Nardello peppers. Biting into the fruit, we found it immediately sweet, but with a slow-building heat that launched a three-year obsession with breeding the ideal pepper. Hot Winter Hot Sauce blends our very own Hot Winter pepper with a variety of organic heirlooms grown with love by our friends on small-scale organic farms. Together we are saving seeds and savoringthe taste of simple food done right.

The PMC was founded by three Lewis & Clark College biology graduates in the fall of 2012 and provides fresh, organic oyster mushrooms to several restaurants in Portland. Growing mushrooms in the city allows the PMC to provide restaurants with the freshest oyster mushrooms available in Portland, often delivering the mushrooms on the same day of harvest.

The PMC grows its mushrooms on locally sourced by-products such as wheat straw, coffee grounds, and spent brewer’s grain contained in reusable (and recyclable) plastic buckets. In November 2013 operations moved into a specially modified shipping container, allowing them again to turn unproductive, post-industrial resources into sources of fresh produce for the city. Although they currently exclusively grow oyster mushrooms, the PMC will soon begin offering other highly-prized culinary mushrooms such as maitake, lion’s mane, and enoki."

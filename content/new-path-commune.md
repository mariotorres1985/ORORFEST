In 2012, Abraham Ingle started building an analog modular synthesizer. Surrounded by wires, switches, and solder, the modular synthesizer quickly became central to his compositions. His compositions are fogs of ambience, punctuated by a pulsing 909 kick, the static disorder of a police scanner, and the intersecting melodies of the modular synthesizer. The unscripted police scanner and primitive nature of modular synthesis mean that each show is unique: a performer struggling with his technology against the sonic backdrop of a city struggling with theirs.
